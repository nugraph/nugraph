# DSI Clinic Notes

# Student Information

**This README file will contain information relating to the clinic** it is NOT to be pulled back into the original nugraph repository.
  

This is a forked repo. The team at Fermi can cherry pick specific things back to the main repo as they would like (and they can also push down new code). Because of that this project will work a _bit_ differently.

* The final technical review will have a smaller weight on the final grade
* More weight will be put on the final presentations.

## Initial work

Before meeting with the team in week 2, please complete the following tasks:
1. Watch the final presentation from last year. You can find the [video here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BoPzuospYZC673yhMPeTxp1Ou1xWNPSa/view).
2. Read the [nugraph paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11872). This is the project that you'll be working on!

# NuGraph

NuGraph is a graph neural network (GNN) for neutrino physics event reconstruction. This repository contains the source code for the following packages:
- [nugraph](nugraph/README.md) – module containing the GNN architecture and data loader
- [pynuml](pynuml/README.md) – module containing graph processing, truth labelling and visualization tools.
